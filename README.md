# ReactPortfolio

AS A student who is finishing up an intensive 6 month bootcamp I WANT the ability to market mysel to potential employers with a live webpage portfolio SO THAT I can get a job and pay my bills.

## Description

As someone who has been in the corporate world the last 12+ years, it is beneficial to keep your resume and your list of work up to date.  This updated React Portfolio is a perfect way to display the work/ projects that I have done over the last six months in this bootcamp.

After this class is done I hope to take what I've learned and transition it into a new and improved role where I can implement software while at the same time troubleshoot and make enhancements to the backend as well.  This portfolio will be a step in the right direction to help secure that dream role.

This project is a react app and I am a big fan of react - I hope to use it more in the future.
