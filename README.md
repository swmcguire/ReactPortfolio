# ReactPortfolio
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

No Installation Necessary - simply launch a web browser and navigate to:  ______________________

Once there you'll have the ability to learn more about who I am, see my portfolio of work, download my resume and reach out to me via my different platforms.

Enjoy!!

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
